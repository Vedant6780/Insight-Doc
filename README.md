# Insight AI Assistant

**Insight AI Assistant** is an interactive Streamlit-based application that offers powerful AI-driven text processing, document analysis, and conversational capabilities.

## Access the Application
Visit the application online at: [https://insight-ai.streamlit.app/](https://insight-ai.streamlit.app/)

## Demo Video

Here is the demo video: [link](https://youtu.be/ZBDC7C6HfnE).

## Features

### 1. **Text Processing**
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of articles or text.
- **Highlights**: Extract key highlights from input text.
- **Points of Minutes (PoM)**: Create structured PoM from provided text.
- **Custom Instructions**: Perform tasks based on user-defined instructions.

### 2. **InsightDoc AI Analyzer( Content Engine for Document Comparison and Insights)**
#### This repository implements a Content Engine utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to analyze and compare multiple PDF documents, specifically Form 10-K filings from multinational companies.

#### Features
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts and processes text from PDF documents.
- **Vectorization**: Converts text content into vectors using local embedding models.
- **Vector Store Integration**: Embeddings are stored in a vector store (Chroma or FAISS) for efficient retrieval and comparison.
- **Local LLM Integration**: A local Large Language Model (LLM), Mistral-7B-Instruct, is used for generating insights and answering queries.
- **Interactive Chatbot Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing users a platform to query the system and obtain document insights.

#### Workflow
1. **Parse Documents**: Extract text from PDF files (e.g., Alphabet, Tesla, and Uber Form 10-K filings).
2. **Generate Embeddings**: Use Sentence-Transformers to generate dense vector embeddings for document text.
3. **Store in Vector Store**: Save embeddings in a vector store like Chroma or FAISS for fast querying.
4. **Query Engine**: Retrieve relevant information and generate insights using a local LLM.
5. **Chatbot Interface**: Users interact via a Streamlit-based chatbot UI to query and explore insights from documents.

#### Sample Queries
- "How does Tesla's automotive segment differ from its energy generation and storage segment?"
- "What are the differences in the business of Tesla and Uber?"
- "What is the total revenue for Google Search?"

### 3. **Chat with Assistant**
- Ask questions or chat with a powerful AI assistant.
- Leverage state-of-the-art models for personalized responses.
